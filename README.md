⭐ Programming Logic Repository

Welcome to the Programming Logic repository! This repository contains exercises and challenges solved in different programming languages, including Solidity, JavaScript, C, and C++.

✨ Objective

The main goal of this repository is to improve problem-solving skills through programming logic, using different paradigms and language syntaxes. It serves as a resource for students, beginner developers, and enthusiasts who want to practice and learn new coding approaches.

🔧 Technologies and Languages Used

Solidity – For exercises related to smart contracts and blockchain.

JavaScript – For logic problem-solving and data manipulation.

C – For logic exercises in a low-level language.

C++ – For more advanced challenges using OOP and STL.

🔍 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a programming language:

/
|-- solidity/
|   |-- example1.sol
|   |-- example2.sol
|
|-- javascript/
|   |-- example1.js
|   |-- example2.js
|
|-- c/
|   |-- example1.c
|   |-- example2.c
